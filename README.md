# ObjectRecognitionNeuralNetwork
> This is a simple neural network built to detect objects in a photo. It is based off of the PricePredictNeuralNetwork project I am also working, with the same base system. My PC isn't very powerful, and even though I run this network most of the time, progress has basically stopped. If you have free CPU, then I would be super grateful if you could help contribute by letting it train on your system.

## How to use:
To run, simply open <code>/Executable/</code>, then run <code>NeuralNetConsoleCS.exe</code>. After that, no further input is required and you can just let it compute new generations to make the network better.

I finally added networking, so you no longer need to send me <code>/Executable/dat/WeightSave.dat</code>! Now, as long as you have an internet connection, the weights file will be automatically uploaded to my server (when it makes progress).

## The current best fitness is: <b>74.89%</b>
Your clients' fitness will stay up to date with this, and this everyone elses highest fitness because of the networking I added. I'll keep this up to date with each network evolution.
